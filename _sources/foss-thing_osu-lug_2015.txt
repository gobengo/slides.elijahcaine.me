Rolling Ball
------------
LUG Spring FOSS Thing 2015 is (the first of many) LUG Club Projects in which we
decided on and complete a project in Spring Term.


Open Source
-----------
The project will be Open Sourced, this means does not mean it's code per-se, it
can be an event, a robot, or a book as long as it's free to the world and open
to outside contribution.


Community Focused
-----------------
It should also be community focused in that it gives back to OSU, Corvallis, or
the Open Source Software Community in some way. This can be creating an app for
OSU, teaching a class open to Corvallis, or just putting an awesome piece of
Open Source Software (that's super well documented) on GitHub.


Ideas
-----
Most important is that LUG does an awesome thing.

There are currently 3 ideas on the table:

1. Create a collaboration API & apps.
2. Host an instance of Habit RPG.
3. LUG Fund Raiser


Brainstorm
----------
What do you think?


Make a List:
------------
* What to do
* Who to do it
* When to get it done by
