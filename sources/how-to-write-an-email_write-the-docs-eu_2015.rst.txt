    awful


...Not Really...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Convenient
* Ubiquitous
* Dependable

**TLDR:** It's really big and useful.

.. note::

    Before I state the problems with email I would like to acknowledge that it
    has it's strengths:

    #. It's convenient. It is  readily available on pretty much every platform.
       It's in the browser, on your phone, and it's pretty secure for those that
       need it to be.
    #. It's ubiquitous. Everybody uses email, everybody has email, everybody
       reads their email at least once a week.
    #. Because everybody uses email we can depend on it. If you send someone an
       email you can assume they read it - or at least blame them for not reading
       it when they drop the ball.


Everybody Uses it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

... and not everybody knows to write well.

.. note::

    Remember how we all raised our hands at the start? Right. We all use email.
    Many people use email.

    The biggest problem with this is that many people who do not know how to
    write, or when to write well, use email. Individuals who are able to get
    their thoughts into text, but do not structure it in such a way that the
    reader is able to understand it well, or even at all sometimes.

Email is Cumbersome

    Steps for writing an email...

    Communicating over an Instant Messaging System (slack)...

    I can only read ~10 emails per day effectively.


My Inbox is too full

    Everybody uses it, so I end up getting too many emails.


You Can Make it Better

.. note::

    Here are some tips for making email suck less.

    Spoiler alert, the secret is to write emails that suck less.

Pillars of a good email:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Organization.
2. Ease of information.
3. Grabs attention of reader.

.. note::

    Having a purpose helps tie things in as I go through my slides.


``To/From``
~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Know yourself.
#. Know your audience.
#. Know your relationship with the audience.

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/audience.png
    :align: center
    :width: 65%

.. note::

    Know who you are in relation to your audience.

    Be sure that your audience is the right audience. Should they know this, do
    they kneed to know this?


``Body``
~~~~~~~~

    :align: center
    :width: 85%

*Not that body...*

.. note::

    This is just a silly joke... hopefully people laugh.

Do not
~~~~~~

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/no.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 85%

.. note::

    None
    Jump right into what you should not to. Momentum permitting ask people why.
    This is a wall of text. Fuck walls of text.


Also do not
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/waste.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 85%

.. note::

    Organization.
    This email is too short. It may serve purpose but as it takes up space I
    feel like it's a waste of my time. If you really only have that much to
    say does it need to be said? Can you say it somewhere else (slack, irc,
    etc)


Better
~~~~~~

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/better.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 85%

.. note::

    Organization.
    This message isn't too long, it's not too short. It clearly has something
    to say and I don't feel like it's a waste of my time.


Even better
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/wellPaced.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 85%

.. note::

    Organization, ease of information.
    This email has a clear structure, it preambles what it's about to tell me,
    then goes into detail, and reminds me what it just said with a conclusion.
    Most importantly it's easy to process.


Bullet Points!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/bullets.gif
    :align: center
    :scale: 85%

.. note::

    Organization, ease of information.
    If your email necessitates it use a bulleted list! People love lists.

    :scale: 85%

.. note::

    Attention.
    This is mostly used to grab attention. You may not want to include this in
    an email about budget cuts but it's perfect for an un- to semi-professional
    email about an upcoming event.

Pillars of a good email:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Organization.
2. Ease of information.
3. Grabs attention of reader.

    :align: center
    :width: 65%

.. note:: Just as a quick review. We slowly worked toward these goals.


Maybe Don't

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/Slack_Icon.png
    :align: center
    :width: 85%

.. note::

    Sometimes we don't *need* to send an email? 

    It might be better to send it over Slack or IRC. If you don't have an email
    alternative in your situation, start a movement, make it happen.

    If you are lamenting all the emails you receive, everybody else is probably
    feeling the same way.


Why Should I Care?

.. note:: 

    You ought to use a medium to the best of it's abilities. People use mediums
    (facebook, twitter, irc, etc) because of what it does well.

    Using a medium to it's strengths respects the wishes of the people that use
    the medium. It maximizes the impact of your message.

    There are nuances. It is hard. It is worth it in my experience.

Make it Count
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    If you invest in your message, instead of phoning it in, it will show.

    If you make every word count, give each line purpose, the reader will
    appreciate this and will care more about your message.


Know Your Medium
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /static/how-to-write-an-email_write-the-docs-eu_2015/social_media.png
    :target: https://pixabay.com/en/social-media-media-social-facebook-419944/
    :align: center
    :width: 85%

.. note::

    The medium is very important. The real lesson I'm trying to get across in
    my talk is not that email is terrible but that email is used improperly.
    If you consider what a medium is useful for then you can use it more
    effectively.

Know Your Audience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    Protip, if you think about who you're talking to and put yourself into
    their shoes things get a lot easier. This step is often overlooked when
    producing any media, including emails!
